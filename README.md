## Password Manager

This is the Password Manager where you can store your passwords.
To Enter into it you need to enter Master Password which will be sent to you through whatsapp and you should have an account which you can get it for free or you can use the second one.
This Password Manager saves the information of the passwords and their respective services(can be email or website name) in a password.jpeg file, So that other can't see if they view the image directly.
The code also stores the passwords not directly but encrypts it and store it along with the key of it and the key is generated and unique for each password. 
When you again run the program if there isn't any file at the end of the program it creates a file and saves all the data.
But if the file(password.jpeg) exists it directly loads the data from it before starting the program.
Here you can not only store passwords but also get new passwords of desired length, can see all your passwords, delete the undesired passwords.
The Loop continues till you quit with the given number as input..
